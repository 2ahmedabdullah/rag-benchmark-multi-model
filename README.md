# Zero-Shot Retriever Evaluation: Benchmarking Dense, Approximate, and Hybrid Search on BEIR SciFact

This repository houses an empirical benchmarking framework evaluating five information retrieval (IR) strategies across six state-of-the-art dense embedding models. Engineered specifically for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, this pipeline explicitly analyzes the mathematical tradeoffs between search accuracy (precision, recall, positional ranking) and computational hardware costs (raw inference overhead vs. real-time query latencies).

## 🔬 Project Context: Why BEIR SciFact?

This pipeline uses the SciFact dataset from the BEIR suite to run out-of-domain evaluation.

Corpus: 5,183 scientific abstracts (PubMed)

Queries: 300 expert-written claims


Why this matters for RAG: Specialized medical jargon breaks weak semantic spaces. If a retriever cannot surface relevant documents within the top results, the downstream LLM lacks the context to generate accurate answers. We measure 5 distinct search tracks at @10 to find the exact point where retrieval quality meets hardware efficiency.

## 💡 Key Engineering Takeaways

### 1. Model Selection & Efficiency (BGE-Base vs. BGE-Large)

While BGE-Large-v1.5 yields the highest raw accuracy (0.7499 NDCG@10), it introduces an unnecessary trade-off in this environment. BGE-Base-v1.5 achieves nearly identical accuracy (0.7458 NDCG@10 via HNSW) while delivering a 3x reduction in query latency (29.05ms) and saving significantly on localized corpus setup overhead. For production pipelines, base-sized models represent the optimal performance-to-compute threshold.


### 2. The Hybrid Fusion Paradox (RRF Dilution)

Combining keyword matching (BM25) and vector search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) does not universally guarantee better results:

The Upgrade: For weaker, legacy semantic spaces like DistilBERT, hybrid fusion significantly elevated performance (NDCG rose from 0.5405 to 0.6031) by anchoring the search to exact medical keyword matches.

The Dilution: For highly optimized retrieval models (BGE, E5), standalone semantic capabilities are vastly superior to pure lexical matching (0.74 vs 0.56 NDCG). Forcing RRF to merge pristine semantic vectors with lower-ranked keyword results introduces noise, pulling down the top-tier rankings.

### 3. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Fidelity

At a production scale, brute-force vector search ($O(N)$ complexity) becomes unviable. Benchmarking FAISS’s IndexHNSWFlat configuration demonstrates that approximate index graphs preserve near-perfect mathematical fidelity to exact brute-force calculations. For instance, BGE-Base on HNSW matched exact Brute Force precisely at 0.7458 NDCG@10, confirming that approximate index strategies can be deployed without degrading retrieval quality.

### 4. Generational Gap in Embeddings

The data highlights a sharp divide between generic text encoders and models explicitly fine-tuned on asymmetric text-retrieval tasks. Specialized search models (BGE, E5) vastly outperformed general-purpose legacy models—standalone BGE-Base achieved a 0.99 Hit Rate compared to DistilBERT at 0.73, proving that structural retrieval pre-training matters far more than raw vector dimensionality.



## 🛠️ System Architecture & Search Tracks

The project executes and logs four parallel retrieval pipelines over the corpus:

```text
                  ┌──► BM25 Lexical Only (Raw Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency Baseline)
                  ├──► Brute Force (PyTorch Matrix Multiplication with L2 Normalization)
                  ├──► ANN Flat Cluster (FAISS Index IVFFlat Quantizer; nlist=64, nprobe=16)
[User Query] ─────┼──► HNSW Graph (FAISS Index HNSW Flat Hierarchical Network Graph)
                  └──► Hybrid Track ──► [HNSW + BM25Okapi] ──► Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
```

1. **BM25 Lexical Only:** Evaluates exact term frequencies matching using the `BM25Okapi` sparse tokens matrix on CPU.
2. **Brute Force (Exact Cosine):** Runs exact matrix tensor multiplications utilizing native `torch.mm` across Normalized Document Vectors on GPU/CPU. Serves as our control baseline.
3. **ANN Flat Cluster (`IndexIVFFlat`):** Partitioning index that groups the normalized vector space into 64 distinct Voronoi cells. It accelerates lookups by restricting the search path to the nearest 16 clusters (`nprobe=16`).
4. **HNSW Graph (`IndexHNSWFlat`):** Constructs a multi-layer hierarchical network graph (`M=32`, `efSearch=64`, `efConstruction=64`) for accelerated vector routing, yielding optimal approximate nearest neighbors.
5. **Hybrid (HNSW + BM25):** Executes a concurrent lexical-semantic pipeline. Exact keyword matching from `BM25Okapi` is mathematically merged with structural graphs from HNSW using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**:
   $$RRF\_Score(d \in D) = \frac{1}{k_{rrf} + \text{rank}_{HNSW}(d)} + \frac{1}{k_{rrf} + \text{rank}_{BM25}(d)}$$

## 📝 Metric Definitions for RAG Ingestion

We truncate all metrics strictly to the Top 10 results (`@10`) because it matches the token limits, API budgets, and practical context constraints of modern LLM prompt engineering.

* **Recall@10 (Quantity Metric):** Measures if the ground-truth document was successfully caught anywhere inside the Top 10 window. Critical for preventing **LLM Hallucinations**.
* **Precision@10 (Signal-to-Noise Metric):** Measures the proportion of helpful vs. junk documents entering the prompt. High precision keeps prompts clean and limits token billing.
* **MRR@10 & NDCG@10 (Sorting Quality Metrics):** Tracks positional accuracy. LLMs suffer from "lost-in-the-middle" bias and pay the closest attention to information at the absolute top of their prompt window. High MRR and NDCG verify that the strongest evidence is consistently delivered at **Rank 1 or Rank 2**.
